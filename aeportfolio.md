- You can also include a résumé or CV as a downloadable PDF.

### 5. **Include Contact Information**
- Provide your email or a contact form so that college admissions officers can easily reach out with questions or further interest.
- Consider adding links to your LinkedIn profile, personal blog, or other professional online presence.

### 6. **Proofread and Edit**
- Review your portfolio multiple times to catch any typos, grammatical errors, or inconsistencies.
- Ask a teacher, mentor, or trusted friend to review your portfolio and provide feedback.

### 7. **Prepare for Submission**
- Some colleges may allow you to submit your portfolio directly through their application portal, while others may ask for a link.
- Ensure your portfolio URL is easy to remember and professional (e.g., your name or initials).
- Test the link and navigation on different devices to make sure everything works smoothly.

### 8. **Optional: Print Version**
- If you want to have a physical version of your portfolio, create a PDF that is well-formatted for printing. This can be useful for in-person interviews or for supplemental materials.

### 9. **Tailor for Specific Colleges**
- If applying to multiple schools, consider tailoring your portfolio for each one by highlighting projects that are particularly relevant to each program.

### 10. **Regular Updates**
- Keep your portfolio updated with new projects and achievements, especially if you are applying over several months.

By carefully curating and presenting your projects, a portfolio can effectively communicate your passion, skills, and readiness for college-level work.
